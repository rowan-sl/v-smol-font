# A Very Small Bitmap Font

A 4x4 bitmap font based on this font by [@lardratboy@corteximplant.com](https://corteximplant.com/@lardratboy/109473260282857788) and [@k@layer8.space](https://layer8.space/@k). converted to a rust crate for use in embedded environments when displaying text on very small screens.

This crate has no dependancies, is `#![no-std]`, `#![forbid_unsafe]`, and full const-eval (you read that right).
